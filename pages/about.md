  ### WHY GROW?
  
  
  ### Nothing stays the same, no matter how big or small
  By staying the same, you will be left behind in the wake of social evolution, no matter how strong or profitable your business is.
  
  
  Growth is more than an increment in **revenue, profit or size**; it’s also about **value, importance and relevance.**

  ### WHERE OUR STORY BEGAN 
  
  
  In his long-spanning career, Verve360 founder [Martin Foon](/team) learned some fundamental and unspoken rules:
  Organisations want to work with consulting agencies that share their values, are authentic and collaborative, provide value-for-money solutions and deliver results that count. 
  With this in mind, he established Verve360; a purpose driven business consulting agency.

  ### A PERFECT BLEND OF CONSULTANCY & AGENCY 
  
  
  Using our business consulting expertise, we help businesses to identify their problems or opportunities and develop optimal solutions using tried and tested data, insights, frameworks and models. 
  
  We go beyond consulting to turn strategy into actions, where you can either insource or outsource your marketing and internal communications or utilise our advisory services by allowing us to mentor and coach your marketing or HR teams.
