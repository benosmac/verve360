  ### Why grow?
  
  Growth isn’t always about what you do; it's about what you're not doing. Most
  businesses define growth as an increment in revenue, profit or size. To us,
  growth is much more than that; it’s also about value, importance and
  relevance.  Ignorance is bliss… by turning away from change, you will be left
  in the wake of your competitors, no matter how big or small your business is.

hearts: >-
  Balancing what you think and how you feel.


  * Some agencies focus on creativity and intuition

  * Some agencies focus on logic and fact based

  * Why we are different is we combine emotional connection (hearts) and
  rational persuasion (minds) in everything we do

  * Utilising rational persuasion, we create, change, embed the perception of
  your organisation, products and services in people’s minds

  * We also use emotional connection to influence how people think and feel
  about who you are and what you do.


  The benefit – A balanced approach to capture a bigger market share
standingout: "Standing head and shoulders above the rest.\n\n* Conforming makes you just like the others\n* In this small, crowded and competitive Australian market, you cannot afford to be just like the others\n* If customers cannot see how you’re different from others, then you are invisible\n* It’s about being\_bold, showing and proving how you’re\_different, and better, then the rest\n* If you believe that\_you cannot solve new problems using old solutions, then\_let’s talk\n* Make you the number 1 choice"

  Don’t just take our words. Check out what some of our clients say about us.
testimonials:
  - content: I established and led an IT company for over 17 years and worked with many marketing companies and specialists over that time. Most of them delivered minimal outcomes until Verve360 came along. Verve360 helped me to really understand the vital role which branding, marketing and communications play in creating internal brand alignment, building company culture, and leveraging this to communicate a cohesive marketing story that has integrity. For a company looking to grow from small to medium in size, Martin's advice and understanding were priceless. I learnt a lot from the time I spent with Martin and found him to be engaging, supportive and knowledgeable. I recommend him to any business owner who wants to cut through the hype of marketing, create an aligned internal and external brand, to achieve excellent outcomes.
