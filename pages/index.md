  ### Why grow?
  
  Most businesses define growth as an increment in revenue, profit or size. To us, growth is much more than that; it’s also about value, importance and relevance.

  Ignorance is bliss... by turning away from change, you will be left in the wake of social evolution, no matter how big or strong your business is.

collaboration: >-
  **We believe in working together to achieve shared goals**


  To win new customers and keep your existing ones, we believe that the most effective way is to truly understand what they need and want. The most efficient way of doing this is through genuine collaboration, where we harness each other’s comparative advantage, share ideas and knowledge and have an authentic and open partnership.


  True collaboration improves your bottom line.

  We ensure your messaging speaks to your customers’ needs, with a singular
  voice. We develop and execute plans that gives direction, breeds passion,
  provides synergy to your employees, customers and partners.

  Price is important. Value even more so. We are empathetic to your business
  needs, we scale our services and tailor our solution to your budget without
  compromising on the quality of work delivered. 


  We enable you to achieve more, consistently and at a lower cost.
hearts: >-
  **We believe in balancing what you think and how you feel.**


  Unlike some agencies who focus on creativity and intuition and others who focus on logic and the facts, we are one of only a handful of agencies that focus on both hearts and minds. By using rational persuasion, we create, change and embed the perception of your organisation, products and services in people’s minds. We also use emotional connection to influence how people think and feel about who you are and what you do.


  The benefit – A balanced approach to capture a bigger market share
standingout: >-

  **We believe in towering above the rest.**


  Conforming makes you just like the others and in this small, crowded and competitive Australian market, it’s a risk your business can’t afford to take. If customers can’t see what makes you unique to the others, then you are invisible. It’s our job to help you be bold and show and prove how you’re different and better than the rest.


  Make your company the number 1 choice.

  - content: >- 
             I established and led an IT company for over 17 years and worked with many marketing companies and specialists over that time. Most of them delivered minimal outcomes until Verve360 came along. 


             Verve360 helped me to really understand the vital role which branding, marketing and communications play in creating internal brand alignment, building company culture, and leveraging this to communicate a cohesive marketing story that has integrity. 


             For a company looking to grow from small to medium in size, Martin's advice and understanding were priceless. I learnt a lot from the time I spent with Martin and found him to be engaging, supportive and knowledgeable. 


             I recommend him to any business owner who wants to cut through the hype of marketing, create an aligned internal and external brand, to achieve excellent outcomes.
