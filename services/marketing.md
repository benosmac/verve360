  Do you know the value of marketing but don’t have the resources to invest in it?


  Are you sure you’re using the right marketing tools to target your customers?


  Or, perhaps you do have the resources but haven’t found the right person to help?


  Or, your sales and marketing functions are not aligned, therefore, you are not able to harness the power of marketing?

  Marketing is about building valuable relationships to guarantee lasting customers. It is mind share; from implanting your brand into your customer’s mind, putting it at the top of their thoughts, leading your customer to take the leap and encouraging them never to look back. We're here to make that happen.

  
  
  ### Beyond the latte-sipping and glitz advertising.
  
  The essence of marketing is about the strategy you implement to become the first choice of your customers, the promises you make to your market and the reputation you earn when you consistently live up to them.


  Successful businesses know how to engage customers using intelligent strategy. Visualise where you want to be, and we can help you to develop and execute an integrated marketing and communication plan to help get you there.


  We engage your customers strategically at all stages of the journey, from awareness and acquisition to retention and leveraging customers into evangelists for the business.

  
  ### The three rules we follow – Clarity. Correlation. Choice.
  
  
  **Clarity** - Every dollar spent on marketing activity that is not part of a clearly defined strategic plan stands a good chance of being a waste of your valuable resources.
  

  **Correlation** - Any marketing initiative has to have a direct relationship to growth and a positive impact on the bottom-line.
  

  **Choice** – Every business has unique needs. We cater to each client individually and provide only relevant services to their particular needs.


  ### Alignment is the key.
  
  It’s fundamental to align your sales and marketing processes to your business goals.


  We ensure your sales and marketing are built and managed as two parts of one unified entity: the revenue-generation machine! We measure the effectiveness and integration of marketing and sales, through digital and non-digital metrics alike.

  ### One goal. Many options.

  When it comes to implementation, we offer various options, all tailored to your individual needs. 


  From acting as your marketing team’s mentor or sounding board, to project managing many of your various marketing suppliers or taking on your entire marketing functions, we are ready to fire.
